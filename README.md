# Comprehensive ePortfolio: Capstone Project (CS 499)

## Overview

This repository serves as the **ePortfolio** for the Capstone course, CS 499, showcasing my growth and application of software development skills acquired at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

I have selected three core artifacts from my coursework, each enhanced to demonstrate advanced proficiency in specific technical domains:

| Category | Artifact | Original Course | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Software Engineering and Design** | Breakout Game | CS 330: Computer Graphics and Visualization | Enhanced to improve design patterns, maintainability, and code quality. |
| **2. Algorithms and Data Structures** | Course Advising Application | CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms | Enhanced to evaluate and implement more efficient data structures and algorithms. |
| **3. Databases and Persistence** | Full Stack Web Application | CS 465: Full Stack Development | Enhanced to refine database integration, security, and data handling processes. |

### Code Review Video

This video is a **pre-enhancement screencast** that serves as the planning phase for this Capstone project. It uses a structured code review checklist to identify specific flaws and shortcomings in the original three artifacts. I discuss the issues found and lay out the planned enhancements for each artifact across the three enhancement categories.
